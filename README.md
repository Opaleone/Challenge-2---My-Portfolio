# Challenge Two - MyPortfolio

## What is this?
---

This repo contains my second challenge for the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas - Austin. 

The goal of this website is to create a mockup from scratch of a portfolio website originally created by the Coding Bootcamp.

## How I did it
---

First, I created a skeletal, semantic HTML file and linked a style.css file to the index file. Then, I worked to create the different section, labeling them cards. This website is essentially many flexboxes within flexboxes with the intent of keeping different viewports in mind. 

Secondly, I edited the CSS file in order to get my website as close as possible to the page mockup, keeping in mind different color schemes and font sizes.

Next, I attempted to get the sizing of each container to fit the page at every viewport size. I did this by creating media queries at different pixel sizes and edited the CSS at each screen size. This enables a user to have the page open at any size and still be able to view and access each part of the webpage.

Lastly, I linked all the work cards and links within the page so that a user can view my work, as well as navigate around the page with ease.
